## From the original Keynote pageAbout the session
In this session we’re turning a talk about Architecture into a conversation about Architecture. The opening keynote becomes a container for that conversation.

Andrew will be sharing an idea to get us started and the rest of us in the team (Dan, Diana, Gayathri and Mike) each have a role in supporting the process.

Our invitation to you is to share what matters to you, while listening carefully to others and remaining open to possibilities. We invite everyone to contribute at the level that is comfortable to them, and if there is any point where you’d rather not join the conversation, please just stay in listening mode and try to give your attention to what’s going on around you.
