6/23/2022 10:13:35	5	I've never used it before, it sounds interesting but if have to try it before I can give a better judgement.	To try it out.
6/23/2022 10:13:38			Everyone facilitates advice sessions turn by turn
6/23/2022 10:13:38	6	Well for all the reasons that have been mentionned on stage :) Trust mainly and the definition of expertise 	Mob review FTW
6/23/2022 10:13:38	8	I think that If implemented correctly and it suits the team it is great, developers need that freedom to design and grow	
6/23/2022 10:13:38	8	Improved Shared understanding 	Just try it
6/23/2022 10:13:41	5	Good most of the time, you don't have any guard or fallback when things go wrong and people don't always get along.	Monitor how much advice is being followed. Have alarms. Hit the brakes before things catch fire.
6/23/2022 10:13:42	9	We return to the basics, and how initial communities were formed. Even today, there are communities were the chief listens to everyone concern and opinion before making a decision. 	Listen to understand, rather to reply
6/23/2022 10:13:43	8	Experience it works in healthy culture	A healthy team culture ;)
6/23/2022 10:13:43	7	It depends a lot on the people involved. There arent always enough knowledgeable people around. 	Making sure everyone is invested in learning 
6/23/2022 10:13:44	7	You need to be able to find the right people and to change the way the organization thins	People must be aware of each other skills. Especially in a remote company this can be tricky. Have some session where people meet and talk
6/23/2022 10:13:44	5	I'm not certain you get the expert advice you need. You get opinions rather than actual expertise.	By ensuring experts are heard and their advice weighted accordingly.
6/23/2022 10:13:44	6	Innovative and inclusive approach	
6/23/2022 10:13:45	7	Advice is primarily a matter of experience	Empower everyone to challenge the advice
6/23/2022 10:13:46	7	We know what we do and what we are good at but we need more precise feedback from stake holders 	Getting our hands more dirty and feel what are users are having problems with 
6/23/2022 10:13:46	8	With the correct people involved and the time, the process will definitely improve	Ensure that the parties and experts are available at the times needed. 
6/23/2022 10:13:46	8	It can be adapted to something applicable	"Just do it"
6/23/2022 10:13:46	8	A new way of thinking, definitely going to try it out!	Timebox the effort and re evaluate the attempt 
6/23/2022 10:13:47	7	Im unsure about large teams or multi team coop	Keep on trying and adapting
6/23/2022 10:13:47	7	Defining boundaries: does the whole company need to be involved to change what is for lunch on a Thursday?	A good place to start to build our process 
6/23/2022 10:13:47	7	It is the correct way, but you need to teach people how to do it	Pairing when deciding
6/23/2022 10:13:51	6	I think it takes time to improve the quality of the advice because people need to be brought up to a certain level. 	Improve the quality of knowledge sharing to make sure that the advice process can have the value that is needed. 
6/23/2022 10:13:54	9	Will people take all issues into consideration?	To have an experienced coach be there to point out issues that should be considered.
6/23/2022 10:13:56	5	It’s context dependent how good or bad it is. I’d be excited to try it though. 	Limit the time people have for giving advise. Otherwise it will become an even bigger bottleneck than a traditional architect 
6/23/2022 10:13:56	7	I trust after validating persons strengths.	Architect talk with others how the decisions are made or what they are thinking while deciding.
6/23/2022 10:13:56	8	I believe the best solutions come from the bottom up	Define experts, domains and ownership. Keep it simple, lean and on the lowest level possible
6/23/2022 10:13:57	7	I think it might work but it takes too long in some context to get all of the advice and it has to be less chaotic. 	A public board that everyone can see which decisions are being made or committed in production. In which the board also indicates which decision has been advice by whom. 
6/23/2022 10:13:57	8	In general I think it can work great, but might be hard to implement in some organizations 	to involve everybody in figuring out who the experts are
6/23/2022 10:13:58	7	I'm generally confident it's a good system, but it has some prerequisites for proper functioning 	
6/23/2022 10:13:58	7	Strong requirements necessary: advice available from experts and people searching/finding all experts	
6/23/2022 10:13:58	9	With trial and error I enriched my skill set and level of expertise	Try and fail, dare to make mistakes
6/23/2022 10:13:59	7	I am fairly confident it could work well in some settings	trying it out in practice
6/23/2022 10:13:59	10	I have full confidence in our experts. If they don’t have the right answer, they will work towards getting the best advice for the given situation. 	Making the decision and advice seeking process transparent. 
6/23/2022 10:14:00	6	Confident when applied in teams with clear experts and good defined affected parties. But I know that those are often not clear nor defined.	Gina a way to define experts (?) and affected parties (stakeholder mapping)
6/23/2022 10:14:01	6	Depends a lot on organisation structure understanding and supporting this	Ensure high participation
6/23/2022 10:14:01	6	Organisation needs to be ready and mature to work this way.	A set of tools, guidance or processes
6/23/2022 10:14:01	8	If team trust and collaboration is high it sounds amazing. For me it is a precondition for the format to work	Be aware of your own biases and practice self-awareness 
6/23/2022 10:14:03	6	I simply don’t know everything. I always value a second opinion	talk about it together
6/23/2022 10:14:04	10	Have worked like this at a client by accident. Was a huge success 	Continuously evaluate, adapt and improve. E.g retrospectives 
6/23/2022 10:14:04	8	More expert opinions lead to better descissions If taken care not to end up in endless discussion	Apoint a lead to the discussion (the one seeking advice should be able to lead thr discussion)
6/23/2022 10:14:05	7	It empowers teams, when the right people are the corner stones 	Support & empower, don't (micro)manage
6/23/2022 10:14:06	7	Not really sure yet what this is about I need to get myself more familiar with that.	I will put much more emphasis on spending time on problem space and making sure that the problem is super clear for everyone. This needs to be the very first step.
6/23/2022 10:14:07	8	I think with the right organisational structure in place, along with coaching, support and transparency of skills, interdependencies and facilitation, this could be a great approach for rapid delivery.	Making sure we have the right organisational structure, 'microservices' for teams.
6/23/2022 10:14:07	5	I have done this before but not often	Try it more often
6/23/2022 10:14:07	9		Speak, say everything what comes in your mind, nothing is stupid, everything will trigger thoughts at the other team members. Eventually you end up with a shared idea
6/23/2022 10:14:07	6	It requires the right people, of the right personal disposition and possess a level of professional empathy that is compatible, which is difficult to find	
6/23/2022 10:14:09	7		clear reasoning process model on making a advice
6/23/2022 10:14:09	8		To get known each other more...
6/23/2022 10:14:10	8	The process will bring creativity and chaos, but could affect stability and security.	Try it out in STAGING before deploying to PROD.
6/23/2022 10:14:10	6	I understand the idea but have to see it in practice	Reflect on decisions made after having all the advices from different parties so as to learn the process and building trust
6/23/2022 10:14:10	8	To be more confident, I think rules should be clarified and introduced.	Make the process transparent, documented (could be very brief), and have rules.
6/23/2022 10:14:11	7		Have a clear expectations on the process and accountability while giving an opportunity for all voices to be heard 
6/23/2022 10:14:11	7	Still junior developer and having a lot to learn	appreciate all advice and ideasy
6/23/2022 10:14:11	6	Less confidence the greater the descision becomes 	Starting small. Mapping out affected parties and experts
6/23/2022 10:14:11	5	Its about skill set	Certification - so you could choose from a pool of people
6/23/2022 10:14:12	5	Missing knowledge and experience.	To stress more the idea that your opinion matters 
6/23/2022 10:14:12	6	Even after getting advice from all parties involved, I worry that we're still overlooking something. Often that turns out to be true.	Documenting advices that lead to specific decision.
6/23/2022 10:14:12	5	Neutral due to a lack of experience with the process	Give us a chance to use it in practice
6/23/2022 10:14:12	8	as long as we can appoint enough SMEs im pretty confident	make a public list of SMEs everyone can use when seeking advice
6/23/2022 10:14:13	4	Not happening in my environment unfortunately 	Trying it
6/23/2022 10:14:13	5	I understand the idea, but I’m not sure about the implications 	Outline possible implications of the process
6/23/2022 10:14:14	8	It's how I've worked for the past 4 years, and it's far better than a central decision maker.	Documenting the decisions taken, in ADRs, fir example, so that they can help future similar decisions.
6/23/2022 10:14:14	6	Lot's of uncertainties.	Imcentivise taking the initiative, but reinforce best practices
6/23/2022 10:14:14	5	It depends of the people s quality	Measure the result with many final decision
6/23/2022 10:14:15	6	Basically, I have trust issues 🙂	to include some sort of accountability process after a decision has been made.
6/23/2022 10:14:15	3		
6/23/2022 10:14:16	7	confident , I think that I can turn all heads in the right direction 	That all parties commit to decision 
6/23/2022 10:14:17	10	It may start chaotic at the beginning but I believe it should lead to something great	Regularly talk/blog/present about what we like / are good at to be identified as such 
6/23/2022 10:14:18	1	Too reductionistic	Collaborative modeling and design skills
6/23/2022 10:14:18	7	I feel that people generally trust each other.	To work on trust
6/23/2022 10:14:18	6	I do think listening is a big skill to master when giving advice. 	Asking if the advice you gave was useful and listen to their feedback.
6/23/2022 10:14:19	9	There is much to learn about the contexts where the advice process is applied. Sometimes for the new context you may not know what people to involve 	to try to make some decisions yourself using the advice process, practice!
6/23/2022 10:14:19	9	If you are not confident in people advice or willing to listen to others advices you probably have a team problem so I'm really confident on that for a good team!	To get to know each other better
6/23/2022 10:14:19	6	Do I know enough to make a wel thought fout advice. Imposter syndrome 	Share and talk about fears. What is common. How do others deal with it.  Remove shame.  
6/23/2022 10:14:21	4	Too much chaos 	By doing it each round of advice will go smoother
6/23/2022 10:14:22	5	Unsure about how well received it will be in the organization. Earlier decision makers will not easily give up their position. 	trying it for some time and evaluate its effect
6/23/2022 10:14:22	8	Great way to break silos, do knowledge sharing and perhaps to lead by example. I like the factor of equality it creates.	Share successes and failures and how any failures were fixed using the same advice process.
6/23/2022 10:14:22	7	I think this system is not growth-proof.	
6/23/2022 10:14:22	6	I think many conflicting ideas can really throw us off track 	Understanding who the affected people are and understanding if we have enough experts to assist 
6/23/2022 10:14:22	9		
6/23/2022 10:14:23	7	I'm certain it can work but it depends on trust and participation as well as a shared strategic outlook	Trying it out to see if it works for you...
6/23/2022 10:14:23	8	I give documented advise mainly	Better understand of how is recieved the advice and always give an extra
6/23/2022 10:14:24	7		Practicing it and trying it out 
6/23/2022 10:14:24	7	Would be fine for 95% of the decisions. For the remaining 5% it can be really harmfull if the wrong call is made. 	A veto for some expert (CTO/Architect). (Eg, this is not advice, but something you have to cooperate in your decisions)
6/23/2022 10:14:24	7	Different experts can have different opinions	Get experts with different views in the same room
6/23/2022 10:14:25	8	Advice comes droom different Angles, which leads to better insights	Just try it out
6/23/2022 10:14:25	6	It is always hard to translate expert thoughts to something useful. And it's even harder to validate if the translation is correct.	Iterate with experts. Try to take things slow.
6/23/2022 10:14:25	6		
6/23/2022 10:14:25	9	The organisation I work for has a super strong feedback culture. I practice the advice process every day	Managers should lead by example, asking feedback to their reporter. The create a safe zone to enable people to practice the advice process 
6/23/2022 10:14:26	5	Crosscheck expert views	repeat and get to the quiet guy in the back of the room
6/23/2022 10:14:27	6	I think it might improve the decision making speed. But I feel it might be a bit of a wild west.	Having a certain control structure to keep someone at the wheel 
6/23/2022 10:14:28	8		to make more senior developers lead by example.
6/23/2022 10:14:29	7	I see it as an opportunity to encourage more people to take and feel responsibility for our solutions, and to grow their roles accordingly.	Make the unit of decision making the team
6/23/2022 10:14:29	7	I am trying to be optimistic but I have my doubts 	Make the decision making process more inclusive. More than one person should have a say about the final outcome
6/23/2022 10:14:29	8	Trust people, and allow error in decision.	Use words like "experiment" or "try" so that we gave space to make errors while knowing that risks are there but we are prepared to handle risks when they'll come.
6/23/2022 10:14:29	9	I think trust given is care and trust received. Over time it will gravitate towards health, if facilitated well.	Just give it time, reflect often, open and honestly, as a group and individually, both on the process and the outcomes.
6/23/2022 10:14:30	8	One answer could change the problems route	to step out of the comfort zone
6/23/2022 10:14:31	6		Communicate more and better  
6/23/2022 10:14:31	9	It ensures all points of view are shared and the more information shared the more accurate and easily understood the advise will be	We want the less expert people to understand the advises correctly (and learn), hence keep them in the loop
6/23/2022 10:14:31	4	Current team has not enough knowledge or experience to implement this process. We lack a shared vision how to implement solutions. In team with more trust confidence in the process would be higher.	Working on a shared idea of how to implement things. 
6/23/2022 10:14:31	9	No process is flawless, it requires the right people and skills to pull off	Sharing our personal experiences using it
6/23/2022 10:14:32	7	Eliminates single point of failure	Explore and challenge the ideas and advices
6/23/2022 10:14:32	6	I have some more questions that need answering before being able to confidently use this. Or I need to use it to figure out how it works and what the results are.	Defining up front whose advice we need to ask for some sample decisions or areas. As well as making sure the advice givers are able to prioritise giving advice as necessary.
6/23/2022 10:14:33	8	Works well when used	Train people, help them to understand they can be part of the process
6/23/2022 10:14:34	7	There are some difficulties, but the general proces is hood	Provide or make documention for each component and who its experts/owners are
6/23/2022 10:14:34	8	We have quite a flat organizational structure, and I feel the right people can always give each other. Keeping the communication lines open in this process helps!	Communicate about decisions made!
6/23/2022 10:14:34	6	I think it can work I would just need to see it to be more confident it works in reality 	Having regular retrospectives on decisions made
6/23/2022 10:14:34	7	I am more confident than not	The advice quality will likely be determined by the expertise of the advisor, the communication styles of the two parties and their compatability. The longer the relationship between the advisor and mentee the better as they will better understand each other and how to work best with each other
6/23/2022 10:14:34	8	Other people making decisions is "simpler", is it going to stick?	Exercise letting go control
6/23/2022 10:14:34	7		To try it out
6/23/2022 10:14:34	8	I usually try to explore the problem space from multiple angles, so my advice is based on well considered scenarios (without falling into Analysis Paralysis)	Spend more time up-front exploring the domain, and considering 'multiple angles'
6/23/2022 10:14:35	7	Confident depending on the complexity of the problem and the understanding of the context.	More expertise and better understanding of the context.
6/23/2022 10:14:35	7	Good advice will be followed more often than you might think: people are not stupid	Try it out in in a bounded domain, all decisions within that domain can follow the advice process
6/23/2022 10:14:35	7	If it’s well explained, it could be working	Use written and asynchronous tools to seek for advices
6/23/2022 10:14:35	9	I believe this will allow to scale decision making and allow people to do their best work on their teams. 	Get people to try it... Architects and managers change focus and focus on facilitating the conversations, adding elements that are needed for the specific context of the org. People will see and increase confidence on the process. 
6/23/2022 10:14:35	3	Low because there a no validation 	having the final decision validated by a set of pre-selected people 
6/23/2022 10:14:35	8	I think there are risks with this approach, but there are risks with every approach. I think this is a good way forward that is scalable and fits with the zeitgeist 	Transparency
6/23/2022 10:14:36	8	The amount of advice to be considered must be situational. This creates communication load on advice seeker and givers.   Advice does not take away responsibility - one must take ownership / accountability for decisions based on advice. 	
6/23/2022 10:14:36	8	I love the idea but for me it all comes down to the team	Do it more often maybe in a form of role playing 
6/23/2022 10:14:36	7	It promotes team autonomy and ownership. It should be paired with schooling and guidance to prevent stagnation of solutions.	To embed teams in the broader development plans for the future.
6/23/2022 10:14:37	6	I give a lot of advices but I have often focus shifts, what is bad for my productivity 	
6/23/2022 10:14:37	9	I feel like it could work extremely well in teams that are self aware (and reflective) about their skills and are ready to be held accountable for the decisions they made.	accepting that it’s okay to make “bad” decisions, if we learn from them and improve that’s all that matters
6/23/2022 10:14:37	8	The advice I have given so far has led to good results for my teams 	Starting to experiment with it in low risk tasks until the entire team gets acquainted with the mechanics 
6/23/2022 10:14:38	3	Low because there a no validation 	having the final decision validated by a set of pre-selected people 
6/23/2022 10:14:38	7	It can work well in mature enough teams. But doesn’t every team think they’re mature?	Have a set of heuristics to decide whether the team is mature enough.
6/23/2022 10:14:38	7	Not afraid to ask questions to get to a common understanding of the problem 	An open and inclusive culture
6/23/2022 10:14:38	7	I think people to want to take advice into consideration. But finding and getting advice and talking to people is a lot of hard work, when you can just do your own thing instead. 	Trust people to step up to the occasion. 
6/23/2022 10:14:40	7	Diverse complex decisions are better Unfortunately, it’s going to be tricky to get people to adhere to the advise process	Pair and mob programming Liberating structures Decision records Rollbackable decisions (refactoring!! )
6/23/2022 10:14:40	7	good but working on communication skills	empathy, listening (in bold) and effective communication
6/23/2022 10:14:42	10	Gut feeling 	Declare it as an experiment and just try it and see if it’s better than the current solution 
6/23/2022 10:14:42	5	It totally depends on the situation 	Find a way to unify/share the knowledge gained
6/23/2022 10:14:42	7	You never know what others know and what is their context. Very little people see what is the bigger picture focusing on their daily stuff. So you don't know what you're missing when advising and if everyone is at the same level of understanding.	Shared big picture, shared space for decision-making. Simple unobtrusive governance.
6/23/2022 10:14:42	6	You can have very good advices from some team members but also been under watered by non efficient advices	Always answer an advice by a positive thing even if we don’t agree
6/23/2022 10:14:43	9	Rate based on my current team that I trust and know well.	- Weekly meetings to reinforce and align directions - Proper induction to the team process so the person is not treated as lower value - As an architect show from the bery begin you are a part of the team and you have equal voice than other team members
6/23/2022 10:14:43	7	7 for team empowerment and giving control back missing 3 for more decision sharing from teams. They have tendency to forget about communication  	Openness and transparency 
6/23/2022 10:14:43	7	In some groups it might work better, in others not	just try it and reflect 
6/23/2022 10:14:44	8	Really powerful to empower teams to move forward without being blocked by powerpoint  architect	Share a limited number of cross-team priorities helping to prioritize the time of experts that should provide advices
6/23/2022 10:14:44	8	Im confident that others and together you get the best disicion. Lik in deepdemocray	Read the book deepdemocracy
6/23/2022 10:14:44	5	People won't want to seek advice from everyone 	Restrict seeking advice to the feature team and optionally an obviously big stakeholder
6/23/2022 10:14:44	8	I am confident on the good will of the advisors, but I am not sure they will have enough time to understand the full context 	The workload shouldn't be overwhelming. People need to have time to do their usual tasks, + all the other things we expect from them.
6/23/2022 10:14:45	8	decision-makers are often biased	Advice to people who trust you
6/23/2022 10:14:46	9	All advice is welcome because even the worst advice is advice you know you don't want to implement.	To trust the process 
6/23/2022 10:14:46	6	There are many factors that need to be considered in an advice process and thus my confidence rating is average	To make everybody feel really free to share their thoughts
6/23/2022 10:14:46	8	The process is good atm but as the company scales it could be problematic.	Can make it better by making the expertise sharing part asynchronous or indirect. I.e with good documentation or just regular knowledge sharing.
6/23/2022 10:14:46	8		Having tolerance for mistakes
6/23/2022 10:14:46	7	I think I'm good at collecting the input and combining it into a solution. Less good at dealing with conflicts between stakeholders 	Practice 
6/23/2022 10:14:47	8		just live it.
6/23/2022 10:14:48	9	Allows you to collect useful insights 	Define scoping and some ground rules
6/23/2022 10:14:48	6	For the reasons mentioned: lack of trust, slowing things down gathering all this advice instead of speeding things up	explaining to everyone who you can reach out to for advice on what topic, set up a feedback loop on decisions made, foster a trustful environment 
6/23/2022 10:14:49	9	I understand by advice also invitation, that is a powerful process. You offer data and perspective, not pushing. What I think we need to be careful about is the process: watch out to not offer unsolicited advice 	Collaborative decision making : offer and address objections to a decision 
6/23/2022 10:14:49	3		Confidence is driven by results. So great results will boost confidence.
6/23/2022 10:14:49	7	There are some requisits to exist in advance, in order to have such advice environment.	
6/23/2022 10:14:49	9	Once we trust our colleagues I’m sure their a giving their best advice at that moment. The key, in my opinion, is to be iterative and leave big decisions to be made ONLY when needed. To be close to the business is key to gather quality advice. But I’m confident that we as team can listen to advices and come up with great decisions.	Make decisions together. Get close to the problem. Understand the problem. Leave no questions behind.
6/23/2022 10:14:49	9	You're playing the telephone game sometimes. The context where the decision was taken may differ from the explanation you receive while asked for advice. 	All actors, or the majority of it, participate in the making
6/23/2022 10:14:50	7	I think it is a great idea, and believe it is the right way to go about working. But, I think in practice it won’t always work out well.	Teams need to know who the “affected parties” and “experts” are. Similar to a language glossary or wiki, some kind of similar product/organisation glossary will help understand who people and teams are.
6/23/2022 10:14:50	5	Cool on paper, fragile to stick	Experiment it locally
6/23/2022 10:14:50	7		You learn from the mistakes of people that took your advice.
6/23/2022 10:14:51	7	I would give it a shot, but I’m still skeptical 	Form „circles“ of expertise, which act like first point of contact for advice seeking teams in a distinct topic. Maybe document these circles in a map.
6/23/2022 10:14:51	7	Takes to long, the experts needs time to understand projects. 	Make the expert part of the development process. Create an expert platform
6/23/2022 10:14:52	8	It works well when people are confident enough to ask "stupid" questions	Strong feedback/retrospective processes to improve upon previous less successful advice iterations 
6/23/2022 10:14:52	8	I'm confident it could be tested in my context in a limited scope and it would bring value (e.g. insights about the system itself)	Think about it in a smaller scope first (e.g. apply in part of org., apply in a certain area of decisions)
6/23/2022 10:14:52	9	We do it already, as i wrote before.	We make ADR (Architectural Decision Records) where we document: big picture, why, list the options, then mark who participated in meetings about, ask anyone who's interested to leave comments, and then we document what we decided and why. That becomes company's knowledge base. So even if it turns out to have been a bad decision, you can come back to it and learn from it.
6/23/2022 10:14:53	1	Externalising the decision making process to control freaks even if they’re experts doesn’t sound good	Upskill the team so that the advice is not needed and they feel empowered instead of directed
6/23/2022 10:14:53	7	Based on group decision, access to client is complicated	Having more data information your affiche process
6/23/2022 10:14:53	8	If eveybody has their nose in the same direction, I'm pretty confident the advice process would be a great thing to implement	huddle up and listen to everybody's concerns and tackle them. As we all know change is difficult
6/23/2022 10:14:53	8	Team Members are where the knowledge about the problem sits. They are in the best position to make a good decision.	to extend it with a decision review, where the decision made by the team is commented on by someone with good context knowledge.
6/23/2022 10:14:55	8	When I know what I'm talking about, I'm confident to give advice 	
6/23/2022 10:14:55	8	I think the advice is common sense, so its quite easy to he confident in it.	Realizing its not very ground breaking.
6/23/2022 10:14:56	8	More people know more then a few in basically all situations. The confidence grows automatically once the opportunity is there for anyone to participate 	Structure on what questions to ask and how to deal with feedback in a inclusive non offending way
6/23/2022 10:14:56	7	Variety of different clients working on our single solution! Really difficult to make everyone happy	Keep discussing, short feedback loop
6/23/2022 10:14:56	8	Because I am the CEO I take the responsibility anyway.	Good orgabizational "mistake culture", no fingerpointing 
6/23/2022 10:14:57	1	Does not work in all cultures. In Sweden people avoid decisions and conflicts 	
6/23/2022 10:14:58	4		Have heard the business experts and the team.
6/23/2022 10:14:58	8		Have some trust in all participants
6/23/2022 10:14:58	7	Starting small increases your confidence level because the amount of rework is limited in case it goes wrong	Having not to worry about making mistakes
6/23/2022 10:14:58	7	I don't know every aspect of my context	To having them near me in the advice process
6/23/2022 10:14:59	8	I have been a coach and consultant. You get used to not being the decision maker.	Distinguish between reversible (2-way door) and irreversible (1-way door decisions). The former can be made quickly with confidence and without participation from everyone, the latter should be well thought through and require as much consent as possible.
6/23/2022 10:14:59	7	I usually bave time to analyze problem and consult it with ppl.	No pressure. Give a time to understand and analyze the problem. 
6/23/2022 10:14:59	7	As already touched in the previous answers, what if I missen something	Make sure that one has a good understanding of the domain.
6/23/2022 10:15:00	8	I live in Sweden, it’s culture of consensus and flat hierarchy, that’s how most things work there. 	try it. Prototype 
6/23/2022 10:15:00	8	A lot of ground work and mentality needs to happen before, but it's possible!	To make sure we have buy in from the top
6/23/2022 10:15:00	3	Working in a traditional hierachy, so it's hard to get the trust 	Relax a bit and trust each other :)
6/23/2022 10:15:00	7	I am concerned that advice quality is low due to lack of accountability 	Creating advisory groups - accountability areas. 
6/23/2022 10:15:01	9	I have more experience and surrended by juniors developers	Encourage them to invest more
6/23/2022 10:15:01	7	It is something that could work, provided the culture and trust in the team pre-exist.	to establish trust in the team, and make the responsibilitiew of each person clearer.
6/23/2022 10:15:01	9	We basically practiced this in all teams I‘ve been part of (but didn‘t have a name for the process)	Hire the right people. Let senior people encourage juniors to give their ideas from the start. Give feedback.
6/23/2022 10:15:01	8	I do not trust in individuals making decisions, so advice sounds great.	to accept that wrong decisions will still be made and to strive to work for a culture where there is less fear of being blamed for it.
6/23/2022 10:15:01	8	It's untested, so need some experience. But I believe chaos foster innovation.	We should all try it, and when it is a great success, tell everyone else about it.
6/23/2022 10:15:01	9	We already do something similar, and have a great experience with it. The architects isn’t the bottleneck anymore	Loose control and trust people
6/23/2022 10:15:02	8	Ik work with skilled professionals that know what they know, most of the time	Be better aware of the skills in the team
6/23/2022 10:15:02	7		Make the expert network & team responsibility boundaries clearly visible to everyone
6/23/2022 10:15:02	8	It's scary to loose control, but in the end many people know more than you think	Be humble, know what you are good at and get rid of your ego.
6/23/2022 10:15:02	7	Are all decisions taken with best knowlegde pr sometimes only because a decision has to be taken? Also does this make a difference?	Keeping an approachable attitude. The more „fear“ I have of approaching somebody with „stupid questions“ the less likely I am to do it
6/23/2022 10:15:02	10	The development team shares the responsibility of the decision and is accountable for it. They have to understand it and embrace it. The outcom is far better and satisfying for everybody. 	Shared goal and accountability at the whole team level (dev, test, product, operations). Everybody is on the same boat. 
6/23/2022 10:15:03	4	A lack of practice 	More practice
6/23/2022 10:15:03	6	It depends on the team and how competent the they are 	
6/23/2022 10:15:03	8	The rate of success is totally dependent on the skills of all team members. But if all team members have the correct skills, this is a really powerful approach to decision making	Learn by doing
6/23/2022 10:15:04	7	I have doubts that the advice will actually be followed	To push tools such as the architecture advisory forum to provide a safe space to share one's problem and concerned parties + knowledgeable people to come to the "posting team" 
6/23/2022 10:15:05	7	Probably is empowering and working well up to a certain scope of architecture. Might not work so well at inter-system scope (consistency -wise)	Just try it out
6/23/2022 10:15:05	8	I love the emphasis on team autonomy! I think it would work well with some enabling constraints as well.	Demonstrating working software that is reliable and secure built through following the advice process to prove it can work and hopefully help people change their mental models
6/23/2022 10:15:05	5	The are some strong prerequisites for this process to work as expected 	A clear map of parties and experts, so you know who is in charge of decisions. A deadline for the decision process. A set of of clear rules to consider the decision taken or refused 
6/23/2022 10:15:06	6	Maybe the advice process come too early, and some iterations over the problem are necessary 	Giving a clear vision of what the problems and the consequences are
6/23/2022 10:15:06	7	I think the chaos can became a problem 	Periodical meetings to share the decisions accross teams 
6/23/2022 10:15:06	8	I think it will work in most of the scenarios, and possible problems will be related to individuals rather than teams	Share the question and advice among the whole team, so everyone has a common view 
6/23/2022 10:15:07	7		Avoid blaming. Make decision smaller so that an error isn't fatal
6/23/2022 10:15:07	8	Other approaches have drawbacks too, so don't focus too much on why it will not work	to seek advice from a pool of "experts" instead of individuals 
6/23/2022 10:15:07	9	I support conversations and feedbacks. It grows people, make them more mâture, and also more connected, and in the End more résilient together	Westrum organization
6/23/2022 10:15:07	9	In the long run, trusting people to improve their understanding of the problem and techniques to uncover problems/solutions while giving them time to do so. Is more efficient and will scale more.	Start by giving advice instead of commands and make it clear there’s a difference.
6/23/2022 10:15:07	8		Do just do it and evaluate during the proces. It is a process so it takes time to get comfortable with it
6/23/2022 10:15:07	8	Promotes autonomous teams and ownership. Not certain if chaos is will speed up flow in a long term	Measure results
6/23/2022 10:15:07	9	Rate based on my current team that I trust and know well.	- Weekly meetings to reinforce and align directions - Proper induction to the team process so the person is not treated as lower value - As an architect show from the bery begin you are a part of the team and you have equal voice than other team members
6/23/2022 10:15:08	7	Advice is based on what you know. Be informed to give the best possible advice , but try to be open in unknowns. One of the advantages in a non-toxic culture/environment	
6/23/2022 10:15:08	8	I think that you shoud make a difference between advices within a bounded context and decisions over bounded contexts. Within a bounded context it is fine to let a decision be made by the team	
6/23/2022 10:15:08	9	I’ve already successfully implemented this to some extend	Try to encourage people to take the responsibility for the decisions - all of us are architects
6/23/2022 10:15:08	7	When right experts are assigned, process works well. When environment is not experienced enough, this process can drive wrong decisions and put blame towards the people making decisions.	Make people comfortable to say: I don't feel confident making this decision
6/23/2022 10:15:09	5	Difficult to get everybody engaged	Experience
6/23/2022 10:15:09	6	Everybody needs to trust in each other	Trust and open mind
6/23/2022 10:15:09	10	I don't see how as an IC can be expected to care and support a system I'm not co-building. 	Ensure all decisions are properly documented. Context-wise, and trade offs are made explicit. So we as a community can learn from those decision
6/23/2022 10:15:09	10	It would be great to have feedback from everybody. All opinions matters and can give you new perspectives 	Let the team know that they will be seen by everybody and start right now!
6/23/2022 10:15:09	7	I don’t see any generic solution to make this work in every case, the solution depends on how the team interacts, so it’s about team culture and problem context	To listen closely before to speak 
6/23/2022 10:15:09	8	I’ve seen it work. Our PO uses it! 😎	Make sure you involve experts from different areas if possible (e.g. devops guy and the UX guy too!). Make sure you involve people who are passionate about the topic too & also be intentional about it.
6/23/2022 10:15:10	7	People limited themselves regardless of the process. They'll seek authority anyway	To have a feedback loop from the parties routinely skipped or ignored
6/23/2022 10:15:10	7	I see the great potential of it, but I also see a lot ways that this could go wrong or be hard to implement in a company. 	Teach people first how to give advice and how to analyse problems before implementing it in a company. 
6/23/2022 10:15:11	7	I think it is a good culture shift with worthwhile bumbd in the road, but bumps no less.	Make it a game with rules, get all teams to buy into the game, and if a team cannot make the commitment just yet, let it play out in the early adopter teams first to demo it.
6/23/2022 10:15:11	6	Trust is the key and that usually takes time to earn	Introduce incrementally -do a few POCs to get everyone comfortable with the process 
6/23/2022 10:15:11	6	This approach requires a clear vision to guide every potential decision maker. When people’s goals are at odds, decisions will be made counterproductively.	Supply a common vision and reward people accordingly for adhering to this vision.
6/23/2022 10:15:11	8	In small org. Where you know people.	Hire the right people. Don't compromise
6/23/2022 10:15:11	8	Sometime is democratic	Important to try, the next time it’s better.
6/23/2022 10:15:11	7	Do we really as a collective of advisors understand the problem and each other.	The result is written down with a comprehensive motivation
6/23/2022 10:15:11	7		Encourage knowledge sharing, trust,  and colaborarion amongst each other
6/23/2022 10:15:11	4	How to find the affected parties and experts	Pool of decision advicers instead of everyone 
6/23/2022 10:15:11	8	Given people with the right mindset I see this working. Different types of people are no issue because it'll make for a more versatile team	Try it
6/23/2022 10:15:12	8	I think this would be a great way to get a bunch of People to become a team	To make sure that it is ok to make a mistake
6/23/2022 10:15:12	8	It’s hard to say the number as the trust depends on the organisation your in. I believe that in the long term, it will work when people learn to take responsibility. Yet it’s a process and depends on the current place where the organisation is.	to make a safe environment where people are not afraid to make mistakes.
6/23/2022 10:15:13	7	More to do with lack of experience in such decision making and how it would align with all the needs. It seems to assume we are in a well oiled organization.	Increasing trust in the team / organization.
6/23/2022 10:15:14	9	I have trust in my co-workers to do the right thing. If they don’t know about the subject matter. I trust them to redirect to the relevant person.	Make is easier to reach out to other people. Reaching out for advice is hard for an introvert. 
6/23/2022 10:15:14	5	It depends how skilled the team is to derive the right decisions out of advices. Could be very beneficial or very destructive. In the best case it could speed things drastically up	
6/23/2022 10:15:14	9	We have actively started using the advice process recently and it is working well for us 	Try it in small scale
6/23/2022 10:15:15	6	Requires expertise in the team or somewhere, and in finding and communicating with all involved parties 	Acquire experience and expertise 
6/23/2022 10:15:15	7	In think it's the best solution for decision making, but it's having it's weaknesses 	
6/23/2022 10:15:15	6	Sime time I am not sure in my knowledge 	Well but can be more productivity 
6/23/2022 10:15:15	9		Must define the process of accepting an advise. If you have a defined process on who and how something is accepted then you don't have to afraid the advise.
6/23/2022 10:15:16	5	Depends entirely on the people an how much experience they have with the process	Seeing it work in my environment
6/23/2022 10:15:17	7		Just trying it and see if it works 
6/23/2022 10:15:18	7		
6/23/2022 10:15:18			First improve Trust/Respect among Teams and People as foundation. Empower the people.
6/23/2022 10:15:19	8	It works , WE have implemented something similar 	Have an comlunity to présent décision even After making it . Si pople Can learn & Can also convience to change it if it in a wrong decision 
6/23/2022 10:15:19	8	I believe no one is capable of taking right decisions only by itself. Need to get others knowledge. 	is to trace the decisions over time 
6/23/2022 10:15:19	7	I've seen it work in balanced teams	Make sure the team enjoys working together before you introduce the process, otherwise it's a recipe for disaster
6/23/2022 10:15:20	6	It will require massive culture change, culture is hard to change	Help teams identify and understand their boundaries and vision
6/23/2022 10:15:20	7	This might be a method that could work. Without knowing in advice, i wont rate it higher. But i do feel like its somethjng that could be worth a try. Hence my rating.	Trying it out in a small scale (if possible) at first. Giving small tasks and decision making responsibility to the team to try out if it works. Probably this will work and when people notice it does work, confidence might grow for the next time where you can do the same for larger tasks or decisions.
6/23/2022 10:15:20	6	This flat model of decision-making increases the overall requirements on team-members. It can result in decisions not being made. 	
6/23/2022 10:15:20	7	Confidence can‘t be gained from one day to the other. It needs to be gradually introduced in small steps. 	By introducing a blame free, safe environment where trust is being lived day by day by the management. This is probably bigger than the actual advice process itself.  
6/23/2022 10:15:20	8	If decisions are logged along with their motivations, the risk is mitigated.	Having tools and habit to record architectural decisions - during the discussion process (i.e. RFC) and after they are made (f.e. ADR). 
6/23/2022 10:15:20	6		Ask questions to understand better the problem, and get ideas from people who won’t raise their voice easily. 
6/23/2022 10:15:20	1	Skills	Effective facilitation and peerwise negotiation skills 
6/23/2022 10:15:21	7	Afraid of long lasting decision making	To introduce the agile timeboxing, so you could sat based om the information at hans we decide
6/23/2022 10:15:21	8	We already do this in some way	Experiment with it, do it to gain confidence (or lose all 😉) 
6/23/2022 10:15:22	6	Not sure if the time this requires would be worth it	Doing some easy wins, things almost everyone knows something about, then do some really niche things
6/23/2022 10:15:22	8	Give people inside the company trainings to develop expertise to be able to give advice. Instead of hiring people for these as they miss the culture and history of the company	Use domain experts from inside the teams
6/23/2022 10:15:23	8	Listen carefully to understand the main problem and try to explain in the most possibile concise way that is crafted for the person i’m speaking with	Get rid of must, it should be an implicit process to seek advice from the experts 
6/23/2022 10:15:23	8	The problems of advice over command (expertise?) still existed in the command-approach, it was just something you where "not permitted to question"	Practice it, evaluate early
6/23/2022 10:15:23	6	When more experienced people have an opinion, I think it is had to go into it if you are not 100% sure	Knowing eachother
6/23/2022 10:15:24	8	I truely belive that we have to move this way, not only for these kind of decisions, but for all. Including operationally. The old way is too reductionistic and fragile. 	...formalise the structure that supports the structure, ie. reorg so that the old autocratic structure is removed. Anyone can be experts, for example. All dependant on context. 
6/23/2022 10:15:25	8		To check a previous décision was finally right
6/23/2022 10:15:25	7	I don’t think all organizations are mature enough for it 	Say something about in which context it might work and not work. 
6/23/2022 10:15:26	7	If issues are easily definable, because of size or because of participation between dicision makers, great. Otherwise difficult.	
6/23/2022 10:15:26	7	I have faith in the competency of my colleagues and I’m considering we are alway better as a team or at least in a group.	Experiment !
6/23/2022 10:15:26	7	The advice process makes the participants feel involved and important so they are likely to do their best	To do it often
6/23/2022 10:15:26	9	Encourage people to drive, learn and look for ways to solve their problems	Seek advice for a problem or more 
6/23/2022 10:15:26	7	Giving responsibility is great, but trusting everyone and slowing down are serious concerns	just experiment! starting with low-impact projects and work your way up
6/23/2022 10:15:27	6	.	Giving feedback to each other, every day. What did you (not) appreciate about someone?
6/23/2022 10:15:27	7	I'm confident that this can work, provided there's trust in your colleagues 	Implementing a ceremony or event to facilitate the process, to get newly adopting teams or organizations of this process familiar with this concept. 
6/23/2022 10:15:27	7	I like it as process to come to the "initial draft" of the decision	An additional round of advice (or "review") after the "initial draft" of the decision has been made (review can't shoot it down based on just "flavor")
6/23/2022 10:15:28	5	Depends how sure I am about something. If I’m not sure I”ll keep quiet to save time	
6/23/2022 10:15:28	9	Not only does this solve bottlenecks. It also enables and forces those with expertise to share it. Helping to spread knowledge instead of centralizing it.	Doing it and helping others to be confident in taking time for it and making decisions this way.
6/23/2022 10:15:28	7	I think it could work for smaller companies, less for enterprises	make decisions transparent
6/23/2022 10:15:28	8	I like the idea that people can be trusted. Especially once they feel their responsibility.	to try it out and see what happens. Mistakes can always be fixed.
6/23/2022 10:15:29	7	Generally speaking, group decision is better than solo decison as it draws multiple perspectives on the whole picture	Distributed responsability
6/23/2022 10:15:30	8	I'm confident all the advice that is necessary to make a decision will be represented. I do still worry about reaching consensus when you have too many options	
6/23/2022 10:15:30	8	I wont give advice if i dont feel confident	Know each other better.
6/23/2022 10:15:30	4	I'm my context its hard because we don't have much people with the necessary expertise	Try to level up some people that have potential to give feedback 
6/23/2022 10:15:30	8	I do believe its a beautiful way to build trust in companies	Silence the/your ego’s
6/23/2022 10:15:30	5	Neutral because it’s something supposedly natural when you work as an autonomous team.	Assert as fast and as often as possible by deploying value in production
6/23/2022 10:15:30	6	i would love to take more part in taking decisions, but i am worrired to not have enough knowledge....	sharing knowledge on a regular basis
6/23/2022 10:15:31	8	I just like to talk about my opinion but some times I feel like i do it but my colleges stay silent 	Study more and you will become confident 
6/23/2022 10:15:31	3	It’s a design by committee   	
6/23/2022 10:15:31	9	I'm confident with my team members. 	New point of view, at least a different one
6/23/2022 10:15:31	4	How can I get my team out of the existing behaviour? I might try it, but I’m not comfortable with loosing decision control	To establish ADRs capturing advise from relevant stakeholders 
6/23/2022 10:15:31	8	I imagine it will work great under certain circumstances. 	realising that everyone has their own spectrum of expertise 
6/23/2022 10:15:31	8		to make it as easy as possible to approach others with random ideas and thoughts.
6/23/2022 10:15:32	3	Some dont want to make décision. Some don't really care for others' advice when making decisions. 	
6/23/2022 10:15:32	3	Advice process is a tool that wrongly used generates a lot of frustration and FOMO (Fear of missing out) for all the people involved.  Advice could guide to counsel from time to time with fixed schedules where people have spare time to process the info of those sessions.	Autonomous lead until blocking resources
6/23/2022 10:15:32	7	The teams must also be ready for the process	Defined experts and simple access to them
6/23/2022 10:15:32	3		
6/23/2022 10:15:32	8	Assuming the teams are held accountable for their decisions, I think this approach can work well.	
6/23/2022 10:15:32	6	The initiator of the decision is the one who decides how serious he/she takes the advise process. It will be different.	Guideline about the advise proces. Minimum time spend, minimum people asked, although this sounds quite forcing
6/23/2022 10:15:32	6	It is a really good process but it needs high motivated people	
6/23/2022 10:15:33	7	Learning curve, requires time/effort and dealing with potential fallout. Over time, will hopefully bolster confidence, knowledge and productivity. Requires actual experts as well.	
6/23/2022 10:15:33	8	How do you know who are the affected parties or the peiple with expertise ? It coule still fall in the control pitfalls 	
6/23/2022 10:15:33	5	It dépends on m'a y factors (skills, business and orgaization undestanding, trust, fallback process..) . 	Nothing
6/23/2022 10:15:33	4		specify the people or group of people who is the advisor group or as streering group
6/23/2022 10:15:33	4	Seems to be too simple to work well in big company  with hierarchical organization. 	
6/23/2022 10:15:33	6	Some people are naturally more confident than others, I’m not - different views, different opinions - sometimes it’s overwhelming 	Practice & experience 
6/23/2022 10:15:34	4	Too much noise due to lack of a common understanding of the problem 	Reduce noise by better communicating the business goal 
6/23/2022 10:15:34	8	The more experts the more insights you get	Giving experts everything they need to grow
6/23/2022 10:15:34	7	With the right people if could work 	
6/23/2022 10:15:34	2	Too complex to seek advice from all affected parties for every decision. Lack of documentation for the decisions taken.	Specify which kind of decisions are "up for grabs" for everyone, and which are reserved for a more "competent" group of the team.
6/23/2022 10:15:34	10	I am confident in the fast feedback loop more than the advice. With fast feedback we converge. 	Be transparent about the why and about the outcomes
6/23/2022 10:15:34	5	I think it highly depends on your company culture and the possibility to make small decisions easy to rollback instead of big decisions having massively impact on teams	Understand your problem and make it as small as possible 
6/23/2022 10:15:34	7	Individual decisions along with expert advice complement the plan end to end visibility.	Having whole picture 
6/23/2022 10:15:34	8	If you cannot deal with bad outcomes of this process, you’re most likely having bigger problems anyway. So in that sense, I’d rather have a collaborative, empowering process than a top down one.	Trying it out, see how it guess, adjust along the way.
6/23/2022 10:15:34	8	I like these conversations and am a fan of self-organized teams	being an even better good listener 
6/23/2022 10:15:35	7	I feel there's a limit to number of parties and cultural specificities on how to bring the consultation and coming to an satisfactory consensus (or not :)).	Nurturing safe communication.
6/23/2022 10:15:35	7	Idea is great but relies heavily on ppl 	
6/23/2022 10:15:36	6	I think it works under certain environments. Not always and in all cultures and organizations 	Show results of the process in critical conditions like an hospital
6/23/2022 10:15:36	6	Its success is highly dependent in which context you're applying it.	We must know in which type of cynefin domain we're operating to know how much we can rely on expertise
6/23/2022 10:15:36	8	I like that the more everyone practices giving advice, the better they’ll get at it	Practice giving advice. Think about what you would say, even if you don’t say it. Soon you’ll be confident enough to try
6/23/2022 10:15:37	7	Mostly it turns out right. Sometimes teams need to take the decision making to themselves. But other occasions need long term thinking, which leads towards someone giving the advice. I think it should be a balance	Improving depends on trust, so teambuilding will improve the way advice is spersed and effective
6/23/2022 10:15:37	8	Understanding the problem and right people to understand the proces are crucial. There is always a chance to miss some part or make a mistake.	Architecture Decision Log may help to gather past and current decisions and work on constant improvement 
6/23/2022 10:15:37	7	not always sure if my advice is implemented in a way of my thinking	try to understand the really situation 
6/23/2022 10:15:37	6	I might need to make sure that team have enough trust to do this.	to trial and error, let the team do and fail.
6/23/2022 10:15:37	8	Quiet confident because it’s from real parties.	
6/23/2022 10:15:37	6	Maybe because it can be too unclear. Maybe it needs some other rules to be improved.	Limit people number. Organise teams around context. Feel free to join or leave.
6/23/2022 10:15:38	6	confidence is self-confidence, so have to feel self-confident first	music!
6/23/2022 10:15:38	7	I can be 100 percent confident on the things I have done myself. But I’m not confident If I advice on a thing that i have not worked on.	lets do a hackathon. 
6/23/2022 10:15:38	7	Advice is mostly followed and is also the right advice most of the time in retrospect	Trust the process and know there's always a better option. FOBO is real
6/23/2022 10:15:38	7	Obviously, it depends on how much knowledge I have concerning the subject of advice. But no matter how much I know, I never feel completely confident that I have "the best" answer. I'd rather let people suggest solutions and discuss them and come with input based on my own experience and knowledge 	Don't blame
6/23/2022 10:15:39	7	On the upside on this. People are good at learning and growing if you give them a chance, and this does that at a large scale. People are people though so cant give a 10, theres always going to be problems	Give people a chance, you might be suprised
6/23/2022 10:15:39	7	Some of our choices are made only on the technical side, like we can have a silver bullet for all problems. 	Open the decision process to all roles in the enterprise.
6/23/2022 10:15:40	6	I don't belive I'll get good advice often. What about discussion?	Elevate decision making to the group level. Any group can take any decision.
6/23/2022 10:15:40	8		People seeking for advice and making the decision should be experienced themselves, so being enabled to elaborate the problem and to ask the right questions.
6/23/2022 10:15:41	10	From experience, it helps having trust and transparency between teams and people. Adding in the mix diversity improves the whole system.	Public feed of decision being made in the organization
6/23/2022 10:15:41	7	I guess it depends on the people obviously but if you have a bunch of people that are trustful I am pretty confident it will work	To help people getting involved in the process 
6/23/2022 10:15:41	9	I love it since we have been super autonomous across our many teams, but now we need some level of alignment…without loosing some level of autonomy	Create guidelines, service scaffold and tech radar that teams themselves curate, suggest and contribute to in an inner source model, which will allow them to move faster overtime…and then we can just advise them, within these set of guidelines and principles.
6/23/2022 10:15:43	5	So much people involved can block the decision making, it can take so much time for simple thing	Educate the team more
6/23/2022 10:15:43	6	The more you know, the more you know that there’s stuff you don’t know	Being insecure 
6/23/2022 10:15:44	7	It depends on having the chance to iterate(feedback loop)  on the solution. That makes me more confident 	Feedback loop
6/23/2022 10:15:45	5	I'm afraid of the risk of divergence of the architecture and design of the system while I believe moving towards a common architectural idea is important.	Understanding how a team of different people can come up with individual designs that all fit into the direction in which the architecture is evolving 
6/23/2022 10:15:45	6	it misses some guidance on accountability and decision making/logging	have clear accountability, a democratic system for decision making and decision logging
6/23/2022 10:15:46	8	We’re empowered teams that already follow this process and it has served us well for the past 2 years.	Reflecting about earlier decisions more often. What went wrong? What went well?
6/23/2022 10:15:46	9	Empowering people usually makes them more productive and happy.	try to set up a system to identify bad decisions early 
6/23/2022 10:15:48	7	I'm not really confident in the last part of the process : a decision being taken. How to empower people?	To trust the collective intelligence and power of collaboration, using techniques that make everyone express themselves about the problem
6/23/2022 10:15:49	9	Have been using a variation of the advice process without knowing it. And feel it is a quite good approach, but didn't add a 10 since nothing can be perfect. 	breaking the barrier between interdepartment communication, by some monthly short rounds to get to know the experts, stakeholders and involved parties. 
6/23/2022 10:15:50	8	Not many experts. They may not represent the users well enough + too used to old way of doing and seeing things 	More/better representation from experts.
6/23/2022 10:15:50	7	Have confidence in the proces itself. However, I still have concerns about it's implementation and what that requires.	Teach and educate teams in knowledge to decide them selves or how to find advice
6/23/2022 10:15:52	4	This process can be very fragile. Change a key player that doesn't adhere to this, and everything goes back to traditional	Focus on having fast feedback
6/23/2022 10:15:52	8	I strongly believe that teams make better decisions than individuals, and in my experience this type of process to more people being involved and heard compared a process of funneling decision through the architect(s)	That when somebody makes a decision they should at least share with theirvteam
6/23/2022 10:15:53	6	Companies that would benefit from doing probably have more urgent issues.	Encourage it, facilitate it, but don't enforce it
6/23/2022 10:15:53	8	It just provides all data you need for taking the correct decision 	That it takes more time to correct your solution if you didn’t get the advize 
6/23/2022 10:15:54	5	High turnover in teams not allowing global knowledge of the IS, thus not allowing correct identification of person to get advice from Political game, different objective between teams leading to decision good for a team bit not for the enterprise	Contextualize it to your enterprise 
6/23/2022 10:15:54	6	May require significant cultural changes 	Walk through some concrete examples of how it might work, and some counter-examples of what might go wrong.
6/23/2022 10:15:55	7	It requires alignment on who you should reach out to for advice, and there is the danger of not getting all the advice you need.  However, if a company aligns on this, I can see this working fine. It stimulates autonomy of teams.	Align on who we should teach out to for advice.
6/23/2022 10:15:56	7	Needs some more explicitness about who, by when	I would like to see that the decision making process is facilitated by a low effort and very available written down or paper like living document. 
6/23/2022 10:15:59	5	Difficult to estimate the impact in comparison to a more traditional approach.	Doing it for a small not critical project
6/23/2022 10:16:00	9	My confidence comes from knowledge how wide thinkwr I am	
6/23/2022 10:16:01	8	Overall, I feel advice process improves decision making and making good decisions, but Im only afraid that some crucial voice or crucial expert(ise) may be missing.	Have a set of „field experts” - people specializing in certain areas, so we know early who to consult.0
6/23/2022 10:16:01	6	Many voices want their say, them being experts or not	Prepare an advice and then discuss
6/23/2022 10:16:01	7	I think this is needed to keep teams up to speed. But it brings challenges to keep solutions within a vision of the company especially technology related. 	empowering people and making sure they know where to get support. 
6/23/2022 10:16:02	7	Giving people ownership will get them to step up and do their best. (Most likely)	Trying it and seeing how it goes. Coaching in the beginning, sharing knowledge and ideas. Basically giving people the tools to make better decisions 
6/23/2022 10:16:02	7	I am confident in the process but I expect that our organisation needs to gain maturity in this way of working. 	Change our organisation of teams so they will be organised on expertise that is valuable for our company. 
6/23/2022 10:16:03	6	It only works if anyone trust eachother. And everyone has the guts to bring in advice.  Everyone has to listen to eachother.	
6/23/2022 10:16:06	9	I’m in charge of advices 😜	Train them and involve them in decision making 
6/23/2022 10:16:06	3	Without experience in a specific context... I remain a healthy skeptic. What happens when we need to as a group make a decision  How does that work?	Add some way for capturing what feedback / advice went into a decision and what the outcome of the decision was
6/23/2022 10:16:09	7	It depends on the situation and the individuals. I can see it working in high trust environments, and in low trust it would highlight the reason for that lack of trust. It'll be expensive initially as you learn and make mistakes, so it all depends on if you can learn from your own mistakes. 	Taking ownership of outcomes
6/23/2022 10:16:11	1	A junior fresh from university should not be allowed to deploy directly to a space X rocket	
6/23/2022 10:16:15	6	It could really help share the decision load, but inexperienced decision makers or too opinionated decision makers/experts/affected party could reduce the quality of the decision.	A feedback opportunity on the made decisions
6/23/2022 10:16:16	6	What about the capacity of everyone to know when enter in advice process 	
6/23/2022 10:16:20	5	The process is the decision problem seen from an central architect perspective. Its also an impertinence from the hierarchy. 	Try it out. 
6/23/2022 10:16:21	7	I feel we should have a way to collectively assess the impact and reversibility of the decision. This would help everyone involved to let ‘their guard down’ for low impact decisions, speeding up the process.	See above
6/23/2022 10:16:23	7	Depends on the quality, expertiese and trustfulness of people you hire and in my context is quite high	hire good people
6/23/2022 10:16:32	5	My confidence rating is based on my low experience Level. 	Attending a couple of Sessions would improve confidence 
6/23/2022 10:16:40	3	I don't think everybody can make any décision. There is a right to make bad décisions (sh***t happens) but thrust is needed  and must be gained through time.	
6/23/2022 10:16:47	8	Advice process implies all the team, trying to find consensus. It can be wrong but it's assumed.	Check if our previous advices were good and continue the same process.
6/23/2022 10:16:49	7	Im lucky to be in a team which embraces sharing advice.	Make space for any questions regardless of how simple they may be
6/23/2022 10:19:35	7	Decentralized governance comes with a mature advice process description and knowledgeable co-workers that can take qualitative decisions. So there are a lot of enabling capabilities that need to be in place upfront. E.g. Knowledge management in the organisation becomes an important enabling capability for this to work well. 	Starting knowledge management as a capability in the organisation. 
6/23/2022 10:19:53	9	We work this way in our team + organisation. 	Make sure people get to know eachother on a private level. Makes it easier to read eachother, hence being able to "flow" togheter 
6/23/2022 10:21:30	6		Trust teams(!) to do the right thing, advice or not.
6/23/2022 10:24:17	6	We're DDD advocates in a large company pilot project, and the goal is to prove what it br8ngs. but it's my very first one that has been accepteer by tech leads and architects	Small discussion groups 
6/23/2022 10:27:54	5		be open minded, be polite, listen to others and try it
