Timestamp	What's your role?	Complete this sentence: "What worries me about the advice process in my context is..."
6/15/2022 18:40:37	Technical principal at thoughtworks	Accountability. Who the hell will be responsible if I‚Äôm not? Those people know nothing!
6/22/2022 18:38:16	Enterprise systems architect	Are you kidding? Nobody listens to me!
6/23/2022 9:54:14	Software developer

6/23/2022 9:54:43	Principal Consultant/Interim CTO	The cultural context. At the moment people expect "other" to make decisions.

6/23/2022 9:54:45	Solutions Architect 	Important advice being ignored resulting in big costs later down the line
6/23/2022 9:54:45	Developer	That is very coupled to my reality 
6/23/2022 9:54:45	Software engineer 	Lack of experience of others
6/23/2022 9:54:46	Software engineer	Consequences
6/23/2022 9:54:46	Senior Backend Engineer	People might find hard to find the right person to ask for advice 
6/23/2022 9:54:48	Architect	organizational structure

6/23/2022 9:54:51	Product Owner	People not taking the ownership to make decisions and seek the advice to base their decision on. 
6/23/2022 9:54:52	Solution Architect	Nothing
6/23/2022 9:54:53	Developer	Nothing, more freedom and fresh ideas
6/23/2022 9:54:54	Head of architecture 	It‚Äôs hard to find architects which are agent of change and not decision makers 
6/23/2022 9:54:54	DevOps engineer	How to find all affected parties 
6/23/2022 9:54:54	Developer / Lead	Loss of control
6/23/2022 9:54:54	Tech lead	The person that ask for the advice did not research by himself so is asking for solution
6/23/2022 9:54:55	Senior developer	Ability of team members to communicate
6/23/2022 9:54:55	Developer	No common understanding on who is an expert on which topic 
6/23/2022 9:54:57	Application Architect	Maturity of a team
6/23/2022 9:54:57	Developer	Decisions made by colleagues who don‚Äôt know about all the details of the process
6/23/2022 9:54:57	Developer	It is not always well-defined as I wish
6/23/2022 9:54:58	Senior Domain Architect	When people dont listen to the advice
6/23/2022 9:54:58	Developer	If we are building the right thing
6/23/2022 9:54:58	Software engineer	The slowness this might introduce because of having to talk to multiple parties that might not make the advice a priority
6/23/2022 9:54:58	Lead developer	It needs to be documented, and people need to held responsible if they ignore advise and it doesn‚Äôt work out
6/23/2022 9:54:59	Software Developer-Architect	it assumes people take advice to heart rather than ticking it off as part of process.
6/23/2022 9:55:01	Developer	That not all stakeholders (teams) are included in the advice seeking

6/23/2022 9:55:05	Technical Lead	Adhoc decision making without any governance 
6/23/2022 9:55:05	Software engineer	Nothing particularly. Sounds fun, but I imagine it would lead to a loss of control for some and chaos for others üòÑ
6/23/2022 9:55:05	Lead dev	Give wrong directions and dont helo peapole to growth 
6/23/2022 9:55:06	Junior software crafter	That things become message and cluttered

6/23/2022 9:55:09	Architect	people might be too inexperienced to take the good decisions
6/23/2022 9:55:09	Enterprise architect	no gatekeeper any more, thats why its becoming a cultural topic (its hard for people to seel for help)
6/23/2022 9:55:10	Developer	Advice might not be taken into account, availabilty of people with expertise
6/23/2022 9:55:11	Dev / architect	It becomes a social nightmare. You need to be a straight up social worker in disguise to make this work
6/23/2022 9:55:12	Data engineer	A lot of work is done solo and disjointed
6/23/2022 9:55:12	Product Owner 	Me trusthing the expertise and skills of the developers

6/23/2022 9:55:12	Software engineer 	that people might to enforce their own agenda 
6/23/2022 9:55:13	Application Architect 	People disregard the advice and take the shortest path, not the right path.

6/23/2022 9:55:14	Engineer	Efficiency and decision latency 
6/23/2022 9:55:15		lack of competence of other parties involved.
6/23/2022 9:55:15	Technical leas	Time consuming
6/23/2022 9:55:16	Consultant (in architecture mostly)	They need to know WHO to ask for any issue
6/23/2022 9:55:16	Architect	Advice will be ignored to often, which lead to a architecture not helping the organisation
6/23/2022 9:55:17	Software architect	fear coming from other decision makers on losing a control and a ‚Äûlast word‚Äù
6/23/2022 9:55:17	Lead dev	Losing control and knowledge over how the end solution will look like
6/23/2022 9:55:18	Staff Engineer	The architect could still remain a bottleneck as he still needs to provide advice to many people. I‚Äôm not convinced it always speeds things up
6/23/2022 9:55:18	Tech lead	Irresponsible decisions being made
6/23/2022 9:55:19	Developer	What it there is no expertise in the matter?
6/23/2022 9:55:19	Solution Architect	Teams don't know what to do once given the responsibility to make their own decisions.
6/23/2022 9:55:19	Architect 	Nothing, it's natural for me. 
6/23/2022 9:55:19	Architect	Nothing, I already use it for years. The hard part is just to have people getting used to ask for advice. 
6/23/2022 9:55:20	Developer	The possible lack of structure and consistency in the architectural decisions that are taken.
6/23/2022 9:55:20	Director Logistics/TNO Engineering @ Nike	How to decide who the affected parties and experts are in a complex system or large org/company

6/23/2022 9:55:22	Delivery Mgr	Time to make a decision. 
6/23/2022 9:55:22	Head of Technology	Decision makers overestimating knowledge and experience
6/23/2022 9:55:22	software engineer	different people could make different decision for similar problems
6/23/2022 9:55:22	Director in charge of training	Team members being afraid to ask the questions to the appropriate people 
6/23/2022 9:55:22	Software engineer	How are differences resolved when there's no consensus. Is there any sort of arbitration?
6/23/2022 9:55:23	Developer	Making bad decisions, who makes final call
6/23/2022 9:55:23	Engineer	to make sure that everybody knows who the stakeholders and experts are
6/23/2022 9:55:23	CTO	Security and privacy considerations
6/23/2022 9:55:24	Senior dev and scrum master	Not being sure who is affected, ignoring parties who might object, politics
6/23/2022 9:55:24	Solution Architect	Lack of process for advice might hurt production, something must be documented.  People tend to like responsibility but team of juniors won‚Äôt be able to proceed like that.
6/23/2022 9:55:24	Software Engineer	People bypassing democratics and putting their idea in production because of their ego 
6/23/2022 9:55:25	Developer/Trainer	Nothing, its a great idea
6/23/2022 9:55:25	Team lead	That there aren't a lot of others in the company reading up on architecture and DDD 
6/23/2022 9:55:25	Cloud Solution Architect	That this is apparently not seen as common sense‚Ä¶
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Software Developer	The missing expertise of the junior developers
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Technical Lead / solution architect (for multiple teams)	That i will still be the person that the teams will come to/ask me for advice, which still leaves me with little time.
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Sr architect	That someone is not aware of the right people to ask advice too
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Software dev	Slow
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Domain architect	Not much, as we are already using a similar approach 
6/23/2022 9:55:26	Senior Software Engineer	That as the number of teams grow, consistency inevitably gets lost.
6/23/2022 9:55:28	Chapter lead	Its brilliant and creates commitment. Its how we work.
6/23/2022 9:55:28	Engineer	Design decisions become disjointed
6/23/2022 9:55:28	Software developer	Nothing, that's the organisation I like most as an IC üòá
6/23/2022 9:55:28	Architect	Not everybody in the team will be able to take the advice and make a proper decision
6/23/2022 9:55:29	Tech lead	Not everyone will feel allowed to fontina, because of the cultural hierarchy
6/23/2022 9:55:29	developer	Getting a decision at all 
6/23/2022 9:55:29	Agile coach	Would work in our organisation 
6/23/2022 9:55:30	Project manager	Affected parties and expertise are a very subjective thing. We can easily miss an affected party in the advice seeking process imo. Same goes for people with expertise
6/23/2022 9:55:30	Architect	Number of affected parties is dwindling 
6/23/2022 9:55:31	Software architect/lead engineer	Will the people involved take the right decision?
6/23/2022 9:55:32	Software developer 	Losing time of other people
6/23/2022 9:55:32	Domain architect	What if they take the wrong decisions. What about the overall picture
6/23/2022 9:55:34	Developer	Identifying the relevent affected users, stakeholders and advisors for each decision
6/23/2022 9:55:34	TechLead	that people whose only job is to check others job will be jobless (but that's not really a "worry"...)
6/23/2022 9:55:35	TL and FE Engineer	Collecting different opinions takes time, not everyone is immediately available 
6/23/2022 9:55:35	Developer and architecture specialist 	There are (too) many teams and each had its own priorities 
6/23/2022 9:55:36	software architect	People that thrive on power, and are not in the polarity side of I Vs We can abuse this system. What about the culture or fractal patterns
6/23/2022 9:55:36	Software engineer	Big responsibility
6/23/2022 9:55:36	Solution Architect	Make decisions taking the bigger context into account iso in isolation 
6/23/2022 9:55:36	Senior Cloud Engineer	Horrible things happening in production
6/23/2022 9:55:36	Developer	That it will work too good üòâ love it
6/23/2022 9:55:36	software engineer	people who don‚Äôt follow this process and take decisions without clearly understanding what‚Äôs happening around them
6/23/2022 9:55:37	Software Engineer 	A lot of meetings will have to be scheduled, lots of overhead.
6/23/2022 9:55:37	Architect 	Accountability on the decision 
6/23/2022 9:55:37	Domain Architect 	That conflicting decisions are being made, and we only discover that the decisions have been made when the clash hits....
6/23/2022 9:55:37	Facilitator. Just asking questions 	That some people realy want to be told what to do. They wanne be led.
6/23/2022 9:55:38	Mid developer	That there has to be a criteria for the advices.
6/23/2022 9:55:39	Software engineer	Wasting time of other people by asking advice
6/23/2022 9:55:39	Dev	Too many people may need to get involved, slows down process 
6/23/2022 9:55:39	Tech lead	It's falsy colaborative and too asynchronous
6/23/2022 9:55:39	Developer	If the team has team members that are not able to seek advise and make wise decisions that is a problem
6/23/2022 9:55:39	Organizer, influencer and occasionally technical coach	How to establish it
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Consultant + Architect + Deceloper	A lot of opinions to hear and weight in - slower with decisions
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Enterprise Architect 	Offering enough guidance and advise to all our teams so they can decide themselves
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Software Engineer	The consequences when things inevitably go wrong. With great power comes great responsibility 
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Consultant 	People gaming the system or subverting it for their own personal benefit 
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Software engineer	Although I truly believe in this model, it does create a slow down as we gather feedback from affected stakeholders. However, the results are almost always better in this model. 
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Senior Software engineer 	The team just stays quiet and doesn't offer advice.
6/23/2022 9:55:40	Full Stack Developer 	responsibilities
6/23/2022 9:55:41	Enterprise data architect	Nothing. I'm all for federated decisionmaking.
6/23/2022 9:55:41	Team lead	If not taken seriously, it could lead to disaster 
6/23/2022 9:55:41	Embedded Software Architect	instead of being an advice it becomes a directive answer
6/23/2022 9:55:41	Team lead	Nothing, that‚Äôs a formalized version of how we work. 
6/23/2022 9:55:42	Lead backend engineer	How do you prevent ‚Äòbad‚Äô decisions
6/23/2022 9:55:43	Former enterprise architect...	making sure that all the affected parties are correctly identified and consulted. I love the idea, and at the end of the day some folk will push through what they want through the back door - might as well make it as transparent and inclusive as possible, more likely to get the best result for everybody in that manner as well as faster delivery and results.
6/23/2022 9:55:43	Developer/tech lead	That people will introduce conflicting decisions and move away from the general direction
6/23/2022 9:55:43	Developer	The amount of time and too much discussion.
6/23/2022 9:55:43	It team leader	Low people skills around me
6/23/2022 9:55:44	Tech lead	Some team members don‚Äôt follow existing processes. If everyone had this autonomy our prod environment would get even messier and priorities would go by the wayside.
6/23/2022 9:55:44	Consultant	Different expertise between people giving and receiving advice may cause friction and misunderstanding
6/23/2022 9:55:45	Software Engineer	It might still overload someone who need to give advices all the time
6/23/2022 9:55:46	Technical solution architect	How to adopt it and a lack of experience with the process
6/23/2022 9:55:46	Software Developer	People who need to be involved might not be available and so it might take long for decisions to get made
6/23/2022 9:55:47	Enterprise Architect	Being part of the decision process and having a reel impact on it
6/23/2022 9:55:47	Tech lead	Teams can be too small, while decisions need to be made, the day to day the process might get paralyzed.
6/23/2022 9:55:47	Solution Designer	People making bad decisions because of unknown unknown impact of their decisions. Especially if shortcuts are being taken en the right expert are not involved in the decision.
6/23/2022 9:55:47	Architect	No worries
6/23/2022 9:55:48	Backend developer 	Junior devs who are not aware of the big picture their cool new thing might impact and might be na√Øve enough to charge ahead
6/23/2022 9:55:48	Staff engineer	People not following the process and having to fix things afterwards 
6/23/2022 9:55:48	Junior architect	Lots of people are waiting for each other to make a decision.
6/23/2022 9:55:48	Software architect	Knowing the organization enough to know who are the affected parties. In complex organization, scope boundaries might be unclear for a given decision to make. 
6/23/2022 9:55:49	Head of Engineering	That certain people might overrule decisions made based on the advice process
6/23/2022 9:55:49	Developer	That not everybody is committed enough to take an informed decision 
6/23/2022 9:55:49	Developer / tech lead	Decision making is slow. People avoid making decisions
6/23/2022 9:55:50		Affected parties are hard to define. Expertise in the matter as well.
6/23/2022 9:55:50	software developer	not everyone in the team steers towards a similar direction
6/23/2022 9:55:50	Architect	Ownership of the decision 
6/23/2022 9:55:50	Director	Taking to long and need to have consensus from all the parties 
6/23/2022 9:55:50	CTO	People have different opinions so consulting with affected parties and experts does not yield consistent results, and you still need to decide yourself the best way to go 
6/23/2022 9:55:50	Solution architect 	The expectations of the person that hires me as opposed to the team I give advice to
6/23/2022 9:55:51	Product owner 	In an inexperience team maybe this make decisions really slow 
6/23/2022 9:55:51	Architect	that it lacks a decision making process
6/23/2022 9:55:51	Software Architect 	That the owning team actually reaches out to the affected parties and experts. In my context, teams tend to do things autonomously already without, sometimes, seeking for advices/feedback. 
6/23/2022 9:55:51	Freelance Architect	Hard (to impossible) to change culture in some organisations
6/23/2022 9:55:51	tech lead/architect	sometime we don't want to take the responsibility for consequences of the advice 
6/23/2022 9:55:51	Software architect	People being accustomed to you making decisions, not really feeling comfortable to decide. causing them to treat your advice as a decision. 
6/23/2022 9:55:52	Sociotechnical architect 	That I don‚Äôt understand the problem
6/23/2022 9:55:52	Backend developer	I will be disturbed a lot by ‚Äúadvice meetings‚Äù, and not focused on my tasks
6/23/2022 9:55:52	Solution Architect 	That we are not moving the decisions to the authority. It becomes a democratic solution which does not reflect expertise and domain experts' advice.
6/23/2022 9:55:52	Developer	New members missing historical context when taking decisions 
6/23/2022 9:55:53	Senior software engineer	That some people my not play by the rules 
6/23/2022 9:55:53	Tech lead	Top many possible right answers to a problem. I can't know it all
6/23/2022 9:55:54	Data integration leader	People might not have the global picture
6/23/2022 9:55:55	lead developer	person with less experience making decision that I know is bad or will not work and will require rework later, or issues in production
6/23/2022 9:55:55	Product Manager	When a decision is blocked, some people are bound to take it personally.
6/23/2022 9:55:55	Software Consultant 	Hard requirements may be missed or forgotten when someone is on leave. Although that alao shows a knowledge sharing issue to fix.
6/23/2022 9:55:56	Developer	An inexperienced party can make a decision that the affected party can only influence via advice instead of commandment. 
6/23/2022 9:55:56	Lead entreprise architect	I am not seen as someone taking his Win responsabilities 
6/23/2022 9:55:56	Software Developer	nothing really, I‚Äôve actually seen it work and competently transform the company culture
6/23/2022 9:55:57	Developer/Architect/Potato	To many people not knoting who they should consult
6/23/2022 9:55:57	Multifunctional 	that people agree with me too easily 
6/23/2022 9:55:58	Developer	Convincing the powers that be to adopt the advice process! 
6/23/2022 9:55:58	Engineering manager	That uninformed decisions are being made that will need to be delt with later on costing much more efforts.  How do you know when there is sufficient information available to take the decision
6/23/2022 9:55:58	DDD Facilitator	Some points of ‚Äûold‚Äú decision makers will block team decisions afterwards because they weren‚Äôt asked for advice enough in their opinion
6/23/2022 9:55:58	Big data engineer 	I‚Äôm worried about the ‚Äúmust‚Äù. An advice should not be a command. You socialize your idea if you want 
6/23/2022 9:55:59	Backend dev	Imposing a solution instead of discussing possibilites
6/23/2022 9:56:00	Team leader	Maybe sometimes the adivices are not considered because of communication problems 
6/23/2022 9:56:01	Owner	What if someone is too stubborn and make wrong decision and it has a bad effect which costs a lot
6/23/2022 9:56:01	Engineering manager	It doesn't account for maturity, though I see how it could help improve it. People need boundaries just loose enough to thrive and strict enough not to flounder. How to support that?
6/23/2022 9:56:01	Developer	Decisions can be revisited by others in the team if not documented or communicated properly
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Developer	Ignorance
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Software developer 	Not knowing who has ownership over compinents
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Solution architect 	I don‚Äôt worry about the advice process, in some way I use it already
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Team Lead	Communication issue & high degree of ownership from everyone
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Consultant	How to ensure teams making decisions know who to ask, and actually follow through with seeking advice and acting on it effectively.
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Developer	Nothing to be honest. IMO, the key is to educate people and let them make decisions. We hire talented people to let them work with least extrinsic commands possible. Autonomy for the win!
6/23/2022 9:56:02	Developer/Srchitect	Bad actors (I.e people acting in bad faith; though I‚Äôd hope that team culture can counteract this. Also accountability for a decision should be a good balance point)
6/23/2022 9:56:03	senior fullstack developer	Nothing worries me.  I trust my teammates.  And if I could not trust them, the problem is not about the decision making process, but the team building/hiring 
6/23/2022 9:56:03	Software Consultant	My advice may not gel with what the end-client wants, because their needs weren't understood well enough
6/23/2022 9:56:03	Software Engineer	That those to seek advise from are not approachable enough.
6/23/2022 9:56:03	Consultant 	Sharing the backgrounds for decisions (inside my company). Making sure people have skin in the game (customers)
6/23/2022 9:56:03	Entreprise architect	Be aware about anyone decision in large team 
6/23/2022 9:56:03	Developer & Architect	Local decisions leading to global problems, e.g. heterogeneous technology landscape.
6/23/2022 9:56:04	Team lead	Advise is not asked to the right people
6/23/2022 9:56:04	Lead Architect 	People that do not have full visibility of the complexities will take binding decisions.
6/23/2022 9:56:04	Architect 	How to make sure that the advice process in being followed
6/23/2022 9:56:05	CTO	Nothing, it's been what we've been living. I am a firm proponent for "high alignment, high autonomy". Find ways to create the alignment
6/23/2022 9:56:05	CEO and CTO 	Not enough expertise available, people not seeking advice
6/23/2022 9:56:05	CTO	...whether I become bottleneck 
6/23/2022 9:56:05	Developer	My technical problems are not understood
6/23/2022 9:56:06	Solutions Architect	It‚Äôs how architects should work.But ALL affected parties might not be available or willing to participate.
6/23/2022 9:56:06	Developer	Time 
6/23/2022 9:56:06	Software developer	Too many affected parties 
6/23/2022 9:56:07	Tech agile coach	Gut reactions of traditional decision makers who overrule decisions  In general change management of the practice in organisations
6/23/2022 9:56:07	Consultant / Facilitator	Sounds a bit like command and control. PR styled development
6/23/2022 9:56:08	Develepor	People not being aware of all the involved parties. And si failling to execute this process succesfully.
6/23/2022 9:56:08	Developer/team lead	Confusion with the client. If the client is not speaking to the full team regularly (but only to a person representing the team) will their perspective be taken into account well enough?
6/23/2022 9:56:08	Developper 	That some devs on the project feel pressured to ask for permission to do very basic things such as updating spring boot. 
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Dev	Validation 
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Enterprise Architect	How to handle decisions that affects everyone in a big enterprise? (1000+ employees)
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Enterprise Architect	The number of people that has to be involved. Potentially a lot of people. Could slow down decision.
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Architect	Nobody will be following it up unless management tells people to do so
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Team/tech lead	Lack of Uniform architecture
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Product Owner	Do we have good QA? Do all parties affected mean also a number of developers that have to maintain the code? If so no worries.
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Software developper	Functionnal expertise is hard to find, is not available  
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Architect	Never ending discussions
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Cc	Will get chaotic, Teams will only See There goal
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Java developer	The waiting time for response, or ultimate solution is taking too long 
6/23/2022 9:56:09	Developer	Ignoring advice
6/23/2022 9:56:10	Cloud Solutions Architect	Who decides who the experts are to be consulted? Works only with very disciplined teams and not with self proclaimed experts (ego‚Äôs)
6/23/2022 9:56:11	Developer	That the decision maker needs to take the appropriate responsibility for the consequences of the decision, and that might not be in their nature
6/23/2022 9:56:11	Principal Architect 	Other parts of the organisation still cling to the ‚Äòwe know best‚Äô mentality and will resist change
6/23/2022 9:56:11	Developer	It might not be trivial to find all affected parties of a decision i want to make, so this might be a blocking factor
6/23/2022 9:56:12	Backend Developer	That i have to own it if good or bad
6/23/2022 9:56:12	Lead dev /architect 	Loss of knowledge in platform, and pushback from SLT / board, but slowness if design by committee when something needs actioning 
6/23/2022 9:56:13	Software Engineer	I already do this. And it‚Äôs working fine.
6/23/2022 9:56:13	Software Engineer / Developer	That a person with a strong opinion(but not affected) doesn‚Äôt get to participate 
6/23/2022 9:56:14		That the process can become too cumbersome when decisions need to be made about things that affect a large number of parties.
6/23/2022 9:56:14	Tech lead / data architect	Not having a single bottleneck is nice, but it might be difficult for people to get used to the new process. As a result, they still might want advice from the architect in all cases, which results in a very similar scenario as before.
6/23/2022 9:56:15	Advisor	that I don‚Äôt understand the problem well and can‚Äôt give an advice
6/23/2022 9:56:15	Developer	Conveying the advice in a manner that gains engagement 
6/23/2022 9:56:15	Dev	Different types of persons. Some have stonger opionions but not always better
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Developer sometimes leading sometimes not	consistency of system-wide architectural approach
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Software Architect 	Sharing decisions with criteria 
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Freelance software developer	When working with legacy systems often a lot of parties are 'affected', getting out of that state is already hard enough. Sometimes you have enough experience to fovea forward
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Lead developer	it would slow us down if we take "affected parties" too broad
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Consultant 	People need to accept responsibility for their decisions. They might choose mot to decide anything at all.
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Software architect	To get the advice from people whose knowledge about domain is not large enough
6/23/2022 9:56:16	Software engineer / consultant	Who decides who all affected parties or people with expertise are? Is the role of the architect creating and nurturing this decision making culture?
6/23/2022 9:56:17	Engineer/Tech Lead	how different people with different opinions all expect their advice to be heard/implemented
6/23/2022 9:56:17		Finding people with eight expertize, and length of the conversation 
6/23/2022 9:56:17	Lead dev	Lack of uniformity 
6/23/2022 9:56:17	Software engineer 	Cognitive biases making people hear what they want to hear even when consulting people with expertise 
6/23/2022 9:56:18	Principal Tech Lead 	I love the idea and think it will allow go scale how we do architecture. Only concern is how mature the org needs to be to do this, and also how to make sure that as a whole the org still keeps a clear purpose that provides alignment to the decentralized decision making. 
6/23/2022 9:56:18	Architect 	Teams don‚Äôt have bandwidth to process the idea.
6/23/2022 9:56:18	Analist	People will have troubles finding the persons they need to contact. 
6/23/2022 9:56:19	Productmanager	Rat race of product features being pushed without considering the effects for other users of our products.
6/23/2022 9:56:19	Doesn't fit a standard defition	That is going to be hard to developers who over estimate themself
6/23/2022 9:56:20	Developer	How to maintain mid/long term vision on organisation/products if any dicision can be initiated at any time.
6/23/2022 9:56:20	System architect 	If people seek advice from someone with knowledge, won't they end up asking all questions to the architect, becoming a bottleneck again?
6/23/2022 9:56:20	Lead backend engineer	How to prevent the loudest voice (of a self proclaimed expert) always wins. Generally I still think it is an excellent approach though. 
6/23/2022 9:56:20	Software Architect	teams being protective of their decision/not being open for changes proposed by other teams/parties
6/23/2022 9:56:21	Generalizing specialist	Consulting the people with expertise might still be bottlenecks
6/23/2022 9:56:21	Architect	...that people still feel the coercion of old if the structure still remains bureaucractic, that when push comes to shove the authority still leaks through. 
6/23/2022 9:56:21	Product Manager	the stakeholder 
6/23/2022 9:56:22	Tech lead	Skills gap in the team
6/23/2022 9:56:22	Technical coach	Why are people making decisions without having expertise?
6/23/2022 9:56:23	Business analyst/service designer/architect	Keeping up the level of collective trust in and to the team
6/23/2022 9:56:23	Lead engineer	Not finding enough functional experts in certain cases 
6/23/2022 9:56:23	Product owner	We don't have all the context and expertise  to make the right decisions together
6/23/2022 9:56:24	Leading full stack developer	Repeating myself over and over again and don't getting attention.
6/23/2022 9:56:25	Architect	As architect you are responsible for operational requirements what if your advice is ignored and people break scalability or performance, is t that expensive to recover from? Is it worth it?
6/23/2022 9:56:27	Business Architect	that teams could break the "get in touch with everyone affected" rule to speed up decisions and make local optimized solutions
6/23/2022 9:56:27	Agile Coach	Influence requires certain skills that not everyone has. I often see people, who want to get "authority" to make decisions as it seems faster. So this may look counterintuitive to some. In other words - mindset shift is required and it can be difficult.
6/23/2022 9:56:28	Software architect	People taking the wrong decision after all because they lack experience.
6/23/2022 9:56:28	Architect	It ignores natural power structures that won‚Äôt go away because of process. If you‚Äôre good at politics and bad at engineering you will have too much influence. 
6/23/2022 9:56:29		That people will be able to push through it's ideas by advising only with people who agree with them
6/23/2022 9:56:31	Software Engineer	the meeting times. it scares the hell out of me tbh
6/23/2022 9:56:31	Software consultant	That they will blindly take the advice from me because of my title 
6/23/2022 9:56:31	Tribe architect	some people enjoy not having to take decisions but having them served on a silver plate. I'm wondering how to implement that mindshift change.
6/23/2022 9:56:31	Solution archiitect/enterprise architect 	People may not feel they know who all affected parties are and be afraid to make a decision 
6/23/2022 9:56:31	Solution architect 	
6/23/2022 9:56:32	developer	How to enforce advice seeking process and who is responsible
6/23/2022 9:56:32	Architecture consultant/freelancer	Not much ... Only whether individuals are in a position to indentify all stakeholders. And if they are aware of making reversible decisions
6/23/2022 9:56:32	Tech lead	That people with less experience make big decisions without finding all the affected people 
6/23/2022 9:56:32	Developer	People taking decisions doesn't see all aspects of the problem
6/23/2022 9:56:33	Yes	Yes
6/23/2022 9:56:33	Technical Architect	How to efficiently build a culture of responsible people who will be able to implement that.
6/23/2022 9:56:33	Backend Engineer	Lack of communication between parties taking decisions at the same time 
6/23/2022 9:56:34	Technical coach	The hidden power dynamics. Who is asking will affect the answer you get. It will reinforce existing power structures with white men having disproportionate influence.  If I make a decision that turns out to be bad  i will be blamed, particularly if i didnt take the advice of an older man.
6/23/2022 9:56:34	tech lead, architect	Lack of communication of all the information that was gained in the advice/decision process. Need ways to "document it" / spread knowledge in team. Also, afraid of shortcuts being taken.
6/23/2022 9:56:34	Dev	The responsible party for big change is lost
6/23/2022 9:56:35	Web developer	It's harder for a lead to keep the overview 
6/23/2022 9:56:35	Dev	Bad advices because bad expert
6/23/2022 9:56:36	enterprise architect	We need anyway a global view, that the enterprise architect is quite the only to have.
6/23/2022 9:56:36	Developer	Brings all expertise 
6/23/2022 9:56:37	IT manager	Stopping a really Bad decision when needed
6/23/2022 9:56:37	Engineer	How to identify the experts in the matter? How to make sure we are taking into account all the affecter parties?
6/23/2022 9:56:37		If everyone are following the roles i tink of will work.  But who is the owner  
6/23/2022 9:56:38	Developer	Bad design decisions are made if good advices are ignored
6/23/2022 9:56:39	Integration architect	Often the decision is made first and then people are sought for advice
6/23/2022 9:56:39	Developer	Potential bottlenecks
6/23/2022 9:56:39	Senior consultant	I think it,s great. What worries me the most is how to convince stubborn clients of a better practice, then what they already where doing...
6/23/2022 9:56:39	Fullstack developer	Business would be worried about unplanned decisions.
6/23/2022 9:56:40	Evangelist & Education Manager	Giving good but general advice is a lot harder to do than specific decisions. Sometimes there is nobody with expertise available. 
6/23/2022 9:56:41	Software architect	Not having enough low level / high detail view on the topics on which I need to provide advice, hence provide bad advice that my engineers will follow at face value 
6/23/2022 9:56:41	Software Engineer	The affected parties are to many, so bureaucracy in decision making
6/23/2022 9:56:41	Sr software engineer	People that use their political influence to push their ideas, instead of reasonably picking the right choices.
6/23/2022 9:56:42	Agile coach	Taking meaningfull and conscionous decision. It's hard to be avare about we don't know what we don't Know.  Another problem : organigram are rarely relevant to find the right expert
6/23/2022 9:56:42		Architecture and tech fragmentation across the company. - local optimisation vs global. - how to make sure that ALL affected parties and experts are identified. 
6/23/2022 9:56:42	Technical Architect	the people who could be making decisions don't fully understand the bigger picture
6/23/2022 9:56:43	Team architect	teams will drift apart when decisions don't allign
6/23/2022 9:56:43	Developer	No expert
6/23/2022 9:56:46	Tech lead	Coesion and experience on the team, while I think this approach is great with a consolidate team it could lead to errors with newly created or young teams
6/23/2022 9:56:47	Product Manager	Actually having someone that Can really help in that position  
6/23/2022 9:56:47	Senior software engineer	Shift in intention and implicit interpretation
6/23/2022 9:56:47	Lead solution architect	Does everyone know when and whom to connect with?
6/23/2022 9:56:47	Team/Tech Lead	trust based, and in cases when trust is not on the highest level, than this would present an challenge. 
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Software architect	Documenting the decentralized decision. People come and go in an organisation. It is hard to trace back the history of all the visions from the past and it's drivers. 
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Architecture guild member	The results are not shared, resulting in a wild growth of practices and implementations techniques
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Developer	I feel the need for someone to validate the decision in the end (not m√°ke the decision, but review/validate)
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Data engineer 	Might have multiple different opinions, ends up in creating more confusion.
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Founder/consultant/architect/engineer	Not everyone is good at giving advise.  It will be easy to get biased into thinking all advise needs to be given equal weight  
6/23/2022 9:56:48	Software craftsman, trainer, coach, company owner 	Nothing, if the purpose/goal is shared among all people involved in the project
6/23/2022 9:56:49	SW tech lead	not much, because I/we're already informally doing that and it works pretty well
6/23/2022 9:56:49	Architect	People won't actively seek advice
6/23/2022 9:56:49	Application architect	Lack of coherence between different decisions will lead to big ball of mud with different and conflicting approaches all over
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Architect	Getting hard to explain what I actually do. Being out of the loop on important topics if there is disagreement of the vision. 
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Hands-on architect ;-) 	Disconnection between talkers en do-ers. This is a great topic btw
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Tech Lead	Sometimes it can lead to fuzzy responsibility
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Dev Architect	Leads to unaligned inconsistent design decisions 
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Backend software engineer 	Nothing as long as we are all responsible and have a good understanding of our software. I beleive engineers would seek for advice when they are not certain about the decisions. Therefore I do feel comfortable with the advice process üòÄ
6/23/2022 9:56:50		In the end nobody really owns the decision. Also might it lead to a lot of changes in direction? 
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Principal developer 	More approachable party will have more influence than potentially nor competent one
6/23/2022 9:56:50	Developer	When decisionmakers don't know/recognize all affected parties or people with expertise
6/23/2022 9:56:51	Team lead	If people get it wrong the first time and them keep riding the wave further along to doomüòÇ
6/23/2022 9:56:51	Product manager	Engineering teams are not proactive so they are ok with whatever happens and this makes taking or not taking any advice harder for them. They are not really open to work and collaborate w other teams and not ready for being open. 
6/23/2022 9:56:51	Developer	The team culture
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Tech Lead	Maybe the lack or absence of rules will lead us to some kind of a big mess...
6/23/2022 9:56:52	web dev	gathering all people involved / to forget someone
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Manager	A lot of interactions and an overwhelming lot of meetings with the affected parties
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Architect	that it works great where we have a flat structure with group of motivated people. From my experience, some people want to be led, but not everyone is passionate and takes the initiative. Plus, it‚Äôs not was to coordinate the effort collaboratively; sometimes, ego plays too significant a role or politics. Advice process is something we strive, but organisation culture may be too far to adopt it in the certain point in time.
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Developer	It might be too time-consuming.
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Digital Transformation Consultant 	People making to much chaotic moves, due to lack of understanding of overall idea. Not paying attention to demands or needs of others.
6/23/2022 9:56:52	Technical Lead/Architect 	People going rogue and going against the big picture design ignoring the advise
6/23/2022 9:56:54	Software Engineer	There may be drawbacks to my idea that won‚Äòt be noticed until it‚Äòs too late.
6/23/2022 9:56:54	Freelance consultant	Delays, you don't know all the affected parties, you don't know who is the person with the expertise you need 
6/23/2022 9:56:54	Java team lead	Not everybody is aware of some problems derived by applying some solutions. In order to do this everybody should be equal and project needs to be really transparent. Other worry can be that they don't have experience enough 
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Architect	Project leaders on a tight deadline can cut corners which badly influences the architecture in order to reach their own goals. 
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Integration architect	It depends on maturity of the team(s) you work with. Some teams need leadership or coaching, some can work fine in an autonomous way having a sparring partner. Not all teams are the same. 
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Independent Software architect	To know who are the right people for making decisions
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Enterprise architect 	I‚Äôm not sur this works at scale in large organizations. Or maybe it works but at what cost in terms of energy and time?
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Enterprise architect	The number of persons to seek advice from in large company, with complex IS, that eventually make the process slower than with ¬´¬†classical¬†¬ª decision making process. And accountability of decision when only advice are given
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Principal engineer/ solutions architect	Potentially teams may ignore guidelines, tech radar and standards that we put in place to help them in the first place, although in my context, I am fairly relax as there is a great culture and trust that should allow for the advice process to work well
6/23/2022 9:56:55	developer	I think it's fine. It pushes on autonomy and collaboration instead on forceful
6/23/2022 9:56:55	Tech lead / sution architect	Teams adopting enough ownership, potential lack of expertise to correctly apply advice, proper communication of said advice
6/23/2022 9:56:56	Team Leader	not everyone has a good understanding of business descriptions/requirements
6/23/2022 9:56:56	Lead Domain Architect	Nothing. But it  might not work with rolebased compliance framework 
6/23/2022 9:56:57	Chief Software Architect 	The principle is good. However (1) we need to nurture lots of skills and mindset before this can happen organically (2) to consult all affected and having expertise is a tall order. Who has the contextual information to define ‚Äúall‚Äù (3) we still need a common language to go about the ‚Äúadvice‚Äù process
6/23/2022 9:56:57	Developer 	?
6/23/2022 9:56:57	Senior software engineer	difficult and time prone to talk to everyone
6/23/2022 9:56:59	Technical architect 	How to identify the set of people related to project
6/23/2022 9:57:00		Local decisions without enough visibility or knowledge of a bigger picture
6/23/2022 9:57:00	PO	Enforce and review.
6/23/2022 9:57:00	Engineering manager	Some bad decision may have been taken but discovered months later.  We actually do it in my company and I think the benefits outweigh the risks. It makes everyone empowered and gives high level of ownership. Also gives you the strong community feeling, people develop connections and know who to ask about what. Also, makes developers advance in seniority much faster, since everyone can learn because of the short feedback loop of their decisions.  But we run into bottleneck now of too many people talking to too many people.
6/23/2022 9:57:00	Architect	
6/23/2022 9:57:01	CEO	Keeping everyone honest about following the process - has the junior dev really spoken with the right people, or just talked to the people they are comfortable with
6/23/2022 9:57:01	Staff Engineer	That in a long term perspective it might bring us to an inconsistent system that is full of initiatives but at the end it doesn't work well when you zoom out
6/23/2022 9:57:02	Solution Architect	if the wrong people are involved in the decision making.
6/23/2022 9:57:03	Hands on software architect	nothingüòÄ But want to know hos you avoid decisions goes in circle.
6/23/2022 9:57:03	Full stack developer	Making sure all parties in the decision making process are satisfied
6/23/2022 9:57:03	Make jokes	Nothing 
6/23/2022 9:57:04	Developer	that really important communication with other teams is done by one person only
6/23/2022 9:57:04	Software Developer	That it is naive about the motivation for decisionmaking. 
6/23/2022 9:57:04	Analist	That the decision maker might look at the problem from his role and might e.g. ignore what the customer wants in favor of a technical solution 
6/23/2022 9:57:05	Developer	Sometimes we don't seek advice from anyone üò≠
6/23/2022 9:57:08	Software Architect	We seek advice sometimes
6/23/2022 9:57:08	Sociotechnical advisor	How do you know all affected parties, and how do people feel when they‚Äôre negatively affected.
6/23/2022 9:57:09	backend engineer	people who join would have to be part of a bootcamp to learn our "standards", BUT it would be perfect. This happens a lot with product people that work separately with developers
6/23/2022 9:57:09	Software Engineer	in general I like the idea as it facilitates involved people to talk with each other, but who will be in the end who makes fonal decisions when there is no consense?
6/23/2022 9:57:10	Software engineer 	Not always can be implemented because of who can make an decision
6/23/2022 9:57:12	Architect	People wanting to stick with their old familiar habbits and thus not understanding or not following any advice
6/23/2022 9:57:14	Coach	Nothing, it works already really well in my company :) In my previous company the challenge was for the advice process to be accepted by everyone, instead it was by-passed several times 
6/23/2022 9:57:14	Technical coach 	No worries at all. Anything going against command-and-control is positive. No one should be telling others what to do. Advice, discussion, experimentation and fast feedback is all you need in a healthy environment to converge to the optimal solution 
6/23/2022 9:57:18	Manager in SW dev (former chief architect for a product areas)	People / topic assignment - people must be able to live responsibility of taking good decisions. (However the team itself can do the splitting and jointly assign).  People that are overwhelmed might not be open and seek / digest advice. 
6/23/2022 9:57:23	Software Architecture	Some teams don't seek for any advice before making a decision, because they don't think it's necessary or they don't regard the decision as having meaningful impact. What is more too often business tactical drivers impact the decision without enough consideration of strategic drivers
6/23/2022 9:57:24	Developer	I m not sure if anyone is able to ask the right questions and derive the right actions. I mean if you are a gifted and talented developer doesnt mean you are a good architect, planner on a strategic level 
6/23/2022 9:57:25	Software Architect	Dilution of responsabiilities
6/23/2022 9:57:27	developer	In the end only one person makes the decision. 
6/23/2022 9:57:29	Programmer	whether those making the decision know who it might affect. 
6/23/2022 9:57:29	Developer	To be adviced by the wrong people
6/23/2022 9:57:32	Developer	Having the simplest solution, with choosen technical debt giving the resources we have. As we can make mistake, we can give up a solution and choose another one without regret
6/23/2022 9:57:33	Consultant	Giving advice requires conversation
6/23/2022 9:57:34	Senior Developer	The reasoning for the decision could be not fully understood by all the parties, and same questions would arise again.
6/23/2022 9:57:37	Architect	Do people who must seek advice know who they need to contact for advice on a certain expertise. 
6/23/2022 9:57:38	Technology Director 	Team thinks about my advice as decision to follow 
6/23/2022 9:57:41	Technical Coach	When someone has to advice about any decision regarding anything that affect others there are barriers and burocracy in the transition. Even if sometimes is something that we are forced to do and we lose the opportunity window of doing the things right.
6/23/2022 9:57:42	Solution Architect 	Some People Will miss use this for resum√© driven design 
6/23/2022 9:57:44	Technical lead	People with insufficient seniority;very differentiating opinions
6/23/2022 9:57:47	Solution Architect	How do you ensure consistent quality and use of technologies across all the teams? How do you encourage teams to share working solutions so not every team reinvents the wheel. 
6/23/2022 9:57:47	Software engineer	that if people with expertise disagree, it will be hard for the person to decide what to do.
6/23/2022 9:57:55	Principal Developer	how do you prevent personal/team bias regarding solutions and still move towards a common technical future without having too wide of a variety of tools.
6/23/2022 9:58:02		Sometimes People are not aware of all impact that the decision will have, so impacted areas/ teams will get frustrated about the decision took.
6/23/2022 9:58:45	Architect	Unknown impact without consulting architect, as not all have full picture knowledge. But maybe it's fearing loosing control. Our team is doing open round suggestions and not one person is deciding, team is, but architect will stop some suggestions.
6/23/2022 9:59:27	Domain owner 	it complicates my task as an analist to propose generic and reusable solutions or concepts that van serve all stakeholders
6/23/2022 9:59:28	Developer	That people making decision might not take responsibility of what they have done. Or people would be "scared" to take any decision without having an architect saying it is ok.
6/23/2022 9:59:36	SE lead	All stakeholders said same word in different contect
6/23/2022 9:59:44	PO	Building trust
6/23/2022 10:02:06		It‚Äôs impossible to predict the effects of a change in a complex adaptive system, so how can you identify who is going to be affected by it?
6/23/2022 10:04:38	Head of Architecture	people should honour the advice, take it into consideration, and will do the right decision from technical perspective, and not because of ego or not understand why it good
6/23/2022 10:04:39	Tech advisor	People take advice as law, or expect more... and cultural context is very important.
6/23/2022 10:04:47	Software engineer	We don't really have expertise in the matter
6/23/2022 10:04:49		Teams not knowing all the stakeholders
6/23/2022 10:05:24	Developer	Things that have an effect corporate wide would not get noticed. Not having a shared alignment on e.g. users, roles, security
6/23/2022 10:05:54	Developer	Never ending fights of multiple strongly opiniated people
6/23/2022 10:07:12	Dev lead and architect	People that are not capable of this kind of responsibility. And if your to involve "all affected parties" on every decision, that might be overwhelming.
6/23/2022 10:12:16	Software engineer	I worry about people not following the advice process and making immature decisions
6/23/2022 10:12:21	Architect	Nobody will be following it up unless management tells people to do so
6/23/2022 10:27:49	Java team lead	When you offer the whole team to possibility to offer solutions is great, I'm already doing it, but what I faced is that you find yourself in the situation that the majority of the team agree in the wrong (not best solution), because you know its better the other one and in the end you have to impose yourself, so in the end they see that their solution is not applied. But works most of the times when between all of us we get to the best solution after discussing pros and cons.  This definitely won't work for people that want to decide without any opinion, but will work for sure in a team with developers with enough experience
